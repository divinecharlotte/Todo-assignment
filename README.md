# Todo-List-App

> A task manager app which lists everything you noted that you have to do and their status which might be (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Completed`) each have three icons where you can `edit todo`,`start your todo`,`complete your todo` or `delete your todo`
- By default we have 10 todos which you can edit or delete and and your there just there to show how the UI looks like  
- Due to the way the end points from [dummy todo API](https://dummyjson.com/docs) are not saving anything I just used the local storage to keep storing user's data
